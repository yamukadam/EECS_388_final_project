Final project for Embedded Systems
Built a prototype model of a self-driving car
that has an auto braking system that utilizes a Lidar
sensor, and is also able to transmit steering values from
a Raspberry Pi to the HiFive Board that will then be utilized
by the servo motor to control the steerling accordingly. It uses a pre-trained DNN (Deep Neural Network) model to simulate steering based on video input of the self-driving car.
